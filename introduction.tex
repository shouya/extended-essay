\section{Introduction}

The final of the project forms an semi-complete Scheme
interpreter with the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Basic types \& literals: boolean, character, string, symbol,
    cons, vector, procedure, macro}
\item{User defined closures}
\item{User defined macros, both Scheme \& Common Lisp styled, optionally unhygienic}
\item{\RFIVERS standard library functions}
\end{itemize}

Currently the following \RFIVERS features aren't implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Input/output ports, this could be easy to be added into revo.}
\item{Continuations}
\item{Tail recursion optimization}
\end{itemize}



The project is open-sourced under \emph{The MIT License}, and the
source code is hosted on github: \url{https://github.com/shouya/revo}
