\section*{Abstract}

\begin{abstract}
The main theme of this essay was the practice of compiler theories and
lisp functional programming study. The essay records my journal
about how I implemented a Scheme programming language interpreter in
Ruby\footnote{Ruby programming language, \url{http://ruby-lang.org}}.



I tried to program the project with
two times of reconstructions before the final version is done.
